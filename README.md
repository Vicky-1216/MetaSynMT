# MetaSynMT
Prediction of Synergistic and Safe Drug Combinations for Parasitic Diseases Via Meta-path Information Aggregation and Multi-task Learning
<img src="./figure.png" width="900">
we propose a novel multi-task learning model, MetaSynMT, based on a meta-path aggregation mechanism to predict synergistic and safe drug combinations.
This mechanism effectively captures drug features by enhancing both structural and high-order semantic representations.
In addition to the primary task of synergy prediction, a side effect prediction task is introduced as an auxiliary task to jointly identify drug combinations with strong synergy and low toxicity.

## Requirements
